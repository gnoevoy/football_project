These cleats pay homage to his homeland, with the base adorned with the colors of its flag. The blue and green elements are a nod to the traditional costumes worn during Norway's Constitution Day celebrations.Nike Gripknit is a grippy material that provides exceptional ball feel. The special material covers the shoe's ball contact zone and stretches from the big toe area, through the laces, to the little toe, allowing for precise kicks. It also molds to the shape of the foot and provides excellent grip in both wet and dry conditions. The embossed microtexture works with the Gripknit technology, adapting to the foot and allowing for an even better ball feel.The Nike Cyclone 360 tread pattern allows for quick and agile movements, adding confidence so you can dynamically change direction and feel secure when the game picks up pace.The asymmetrical lacing allows for a larger contact area during dribbling, passing, and scoring goals.

The Legend 10 shoes are lighter and sleeker than any other Tiempo models, making them suitable for playing in any position - whether you're passing the ball with watchmaker precision through the defensive line or defending against a fast attack from the opposing team. The Anti-Clog Traction solution used in this version on the soleplate prevents mud from sticking.Do you see those microscopic dots on the upper? They enhance the ball-to-boot contact zone for passing, shooting, and dribbling. This gives the shoes a sleeker look. Another advantage is the lack of additional padding. All of these elements provide the ball control you need on the field. The foam cushions from the Tiempo 9 model have been reduced so that the foot can be even closer to the ball. Instead, special lines are embossed on the cleats. The All Conditions Control (ACC) technology adds texture for increased grip, allowing you to move confidently in any weather conditions.The technologically advanced FlyTouch Plus leather is incredibly soft.

The Legend 10 boots are lighter and slimmer than any other Tiempo model, making them suitable for playing any position - whether you pass the ball through the defensive line with watchmaker precision or fend off the opponent's quick attack.
