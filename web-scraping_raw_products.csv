","A bow towards full passion support. The colorful design of the adidas Pro ball draws inspiration from the sea of scarves seen in football stadiums across Europe. The official match ball of the UEFA Nations League features a thermally bonded, seamless construction for durability during intense gameplay. The FIFA Quality Pro mark confirms its quality.This product is made with at least 50% renewable materials. Transitioning to renewable material sources reduces dependence on finite resources. adidas chooses renewable materials because they are natural resources that can be replanted and grown again. This sets them apart from fossil fuel-based materials, which have limited resources.Renewable materials are not only natural materials, but also biosynthetics, with plants as the feedstock instead of fossil fuels.This raw material is chemically processed into intermediates and eventually transformed into synthetic materials."," 5.0
