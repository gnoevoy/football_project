Aim: scrape data from rgol and upload it to cloud storage.
Result: get structured 2 files (json or csv) and 2 folders with content images

===================

consideration:

1. add proper delimeter to csv files
2. fix requirement txt (wrong path)
3. better structure code:
    - format
    - comment
4. more validation (if something went wrong)
5. necessity of testing iterative srirpts for one task (won't be maintained)

>> move to data cleaning and loading to cloud storage
