It is softer than natural leather, so it adapts to the foot and, together with the All Conditions Control elements (grippy texture even on rainy days), will help you set the pace of the game. The Legend 10 boots are lighter and slimmer than any other Tiempo model, making them suitable for playing any position - whether you pass the ball through the defensive line with watchmaker precision or fend off the opponent's quick attack. The Anti-Clog Traction solution used in this version protects against mud sticking in the sole.Better feelingDo you see those microscopic dots on the upper? They support the ball contact area for passing, shooting and dribbling, giving the boots a slimmer look. Another advantage is the lack of additional lining. All these elements make the boots provide the control over the ball you need on the field. The foam pads from the Tiempo 9 have been reduced so that the foot can be even closer to the ball. Instead, special lines are embossed on the boots. The All Conditions Control (ACC) technology adds texture for increased grip, so you can move confidently in any weather conditions.Natural fitThe technologically advanced Flytouch Plus leather is unbelievably soft. It helps the boots fit perfectly to the foot, providing comfort without excessive stretching of the material. The Flyknit material around the ankle gives a feeling of secure fit.Grip on the fieldThe plate connects the conical studs on the heel, providing optimal grip and stability when braking and changing direction in any conditions.""]";https://www.r-gol.com/en/cleats-nike-tiempo-legend-10-elite-sg-pro-anti-clog-black,p-161476
