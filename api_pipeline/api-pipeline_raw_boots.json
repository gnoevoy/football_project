            "description": "Do you have an obsession with speed? The biggest basketball stars have it too. That's why we created the Elite cleats with an improved 3/4 length Air Zoom cushion. This model will provide you and the fastest players with the acceleration you need to break through the defense line. As a result, we have created the most dynamic Mercurial shoes we have ever designed. All to satisfy your pursuit of perfection.Exceptional ball feelNike Gripknit is a grippy material that provides better ball feel. It has a larger surface area, giving you more space to control the ball during high-speed dribbling or to finish the game with an accurate shot on goal. In addition, it conforms to the shape of the foot and provides consistent grip in both wet and dry conditions, ensuring a snug fit comparable to track spikes. The embossed microtexture works with Gripknit technology, conforming to the foot and allowing for even better ball feel.Dynamic gripThe wavy tread pattern created by the cascadingly placed cleats covers a larger surface area in the Air Zoom cushion area and provides proper grip. The largest cleat has the same height as traditional mid cleats, so the grip is consistent everywhere. In addition to the wavy tread, we have also used studs in the shape of fir trees and blades, which make it easier to stop during dynamic turns.Perfect fitThe Flyknit upper is designed for speed. The Atomknit fabric, an extremely lightweight and durable version of Flyknit, is placed on the sides to reduce the weight of the shoes and provide support. By combining Gripknit, Atomknit, and Flyknit technologies, we have created the thinnest Mercurial upper, allowing for better ball feel and faster adaptation to the foot.",

            "description": "Do you have an obsession with speed? The biggest basketball stars do too. That's why we created the Elite cleats with an enhanced 3/4 length Air Zoom cushion. This model will provide you and the fastest players with the acceleration you need to break through the defense line. As a result, we have created the most dynamic Mercurial shoes we have ever designed. All of this to satisfy your pursuit of perfection.Exceptional ball feelNike Gripknit is a grippy material that provides better ball feel. It has a larger surface area, giving you more space to control the ball during high-speed dribbling or to finish the game with an accurate shot on goal. In addition, it conforms to the shape of your foot and provides consistent grip in both wet and dry conditions, ensuring a snug fit comparable to track spikes. The embossed microtexture works with Gripknit technology, conforming to the foot and allowing for an even better ball feel.Dynamic gripThe wavy tread pattern created by the cascadingly placed cleats covers a larger surface area in the Air Zoom cushion area and provides proper grip. The largest cleat has the same height as traditional mid cleats, so the grip is consistent everywhere. In addition to the wavy tread, we have also used new V-shaped and blade-shaped cleats that make it easier to stop during dynamic turns.Perfect fitThe Flyknit upper is designed with speed in mind. The Atomknit fabric, an extremely lightweight and durable version of Flyknit, is placed on the sides to reduce the weight of the shoes and provide support. By combining Gripknit, Atomknit, and Flyknit technologies, we have created the thinnest Mercurial upper, allowing for better ball feel and a faster fit to the foot. The Dynamic Fit collar is made of soft, flexible material and wraps around the ankle, providing a snug fit.",

            "description": "Do you have an obsession with speed? The biggest basketball stars have it too. That's why we created the Elite cleats with an improved 3/4 length Air Zoom cushion. This model will provide you and the fastest players with the acceleration you need to break through the defense line. As a result, we have created the most dynamic Mercurial shoes we have ever designed. All to satisfy your pursuit of perfection.Exceptional ball feelNike Gripknit is a grippy material that provides better ball feel. It has a larger surface area, giving you more space to control the ball during high-speed dribbling or to finish the game with an accurate shot on goal. In addition, it conforms to the shape of the foot and provides consistent grip in both wet and dry conditions, ensuring a snug fit comparable to track spikes. The embossed microtexture works with Gripknit technology, conforming to the foot and allowing for even better ball feel.Dynamic gripThe wavy tread pattern created by the cascadingly placed cleats covers a larger surface area in the Air Zoom cushion area and provides proper grip. The largest cleat has the same height as traditional mid cleats, so the grip is consistent everywhere. In addition to the wavy tread, we have also used studs in the shape of fir trees and blades, which make it easier to stop during dynamic turns.Perfect fitThe Flyknit upper is designed for speed. The Atomknit fabric, an extremely lightweight and durable version of Flyknit, is placed on the sides to reduce the weight of the shoes and provide support. By combining Gripknit, Atomknit, and Flyknit technologies, we have created the thinnest Mercurial upper, allowing for better ball feel and faster adaptation to the foot.",

            "description": "Nike presents Phantom Luna - innovative football boots designed by women footballers and created with athletes of all genders in mind. This unique combination of exceptional performance, revolutionary technology and elegant design sets these boots apart from the competition. The unique, close-fitting Gripknit on the upper part of the boot, made of exceptionally high-quality material, guarantees unparalleled fit, greater control and exceptional ball handling in all weather conditions. The Asym Fit technology provides optimal comfort and support, thanks to the anatomically slanted collar and increased adjustment in the middle of the foot, allowing for the perfect fit regardless of gender. The newly developed Cyclone 360 sole, based on the opinions of women footballers, has been designed to easily release from the ground during fast, directional movements. The insoles in these boots can be exchanged, further increasing their functionality and adaptability to individual needs.",

The blue and green elements are a nod to the traditional costumes worn during Norway's Constitution Day celebrations.Nike Gripknit is a grippy material that provides exceptional ball feel. The special material covers the shoe's ball contact zone and stretches from the big toe area, through the laces, to the little toe, allowing for precise kicks. It also molds to the shape of the foot and provides excellent grip in both wet and dry conditions. The embossed microtexture works with the Gripknit technology, adapting to the foot and allowing for an even better ball feel.The Nike Cyclone 360 tread pattern allows for quick and agile movements, adding confidence so you can dynamically change direction and feel secure when the game picks up pace.The asymmetrical lacing allows for a larger contact area during dribbling, passing, and scoring goals. The modified lacing pattern increases adjustability in the midfoot area, making it easier to fit for those with flatter or higher arches. The Flyknit material is responsible for the fit and shape, as well as providing comfort around the collar.",

It conforms to the shape of your foot and provides consistent grip in wet and dry conditions, ensuring a sculpted, spike-like fit. The micro-texture works with Gripknit to help mold to your foot, providing even better strikes with the cleats.Fast tractionThe wave-like traction pattern is a series of cascading ridges, engaging a larger surface area of the Air Zoom unit while still providing proper grip. The largest ridge is the same height as our traditional midfoot ridges, so grip is not compromised. We combined the wave-like ridge with fir tree and blade-shaped ridges to help you stop during quick cuts.FitThe entire Flyknit upper is designed for speed. Atomknit, an incredibly lightweight and durable Flyknit, narrows the weight on the sides and provides support.

            "description": "Do you have an obsession with speed? The biggest basketball stars do too. That's why we created the Elite cleats with an enhanced 3/4 length Air Zoom cushion. This model will provide you and the fastest players with the acceleration you need to break through the defense line. As a result, we have created the most dynamic Mercurial shoes we have ever designed. All of this to satisfy your pursuit of perfection.Exceptional ball feelNike Gripknit is a grippy material that provides better ball feel. It has a larger surface area, giving you more space to control the ball during high-speed dribbling or to finish the game with an accurate shot on goal. In addition, it conforms to the shape of your foot and provides consistent grip in both wet and dry conditions, ensuring a snug fit comparable to track spikes. The embossed microtexture works with Gripknit technology, conforming to the foot and allowing for an even better ball feel.Dynamic gripThe wavy tread pattern created by the cascadingly placed cleats covers a larger surface area in the Air Zoom cushion area and provides proper grip. The largest cleat has the same height as traditional mid cleats, so the grip is consistent everywhere. In addition to the wavy tread, we have also used studs in the shape of fir trees and blades, which make it easier to stop during dynamic turns.Perfect fitThe Flyknit upper is designed with speed in mind. The Atomknit fabric, an extremely lightweight and durable version of Flyknit, is placed on the sides to reduce the weight of the shoes and provide support. By combining Gripknit, Atomknit, and Flyknit technologies, we have created the thinnest Mercurial upper, allowing for better ball feel and a faster fit to the foot. The Dynamic Fit collar is made of soft, flexible material and wraps around the ankle, providing a snug fit.",

It's softer than natural leather, so it moulds to your foot and, combined with All Conditions Control elements (grippy texture even in wet days) it will help you set the pace of the game. The Legend 10 boots are lighter and sleeker than any other Tiempo model, so they're suitable for any position \u2013 whether you're passing the ball through the defence with watchmaker precision or fending off a quick attack from the opposing team.Better touchSee those microscopic dots on the upper? They help the ball-to-boot contact area for passing, shooting and dribbling. That's why the boots have a sleeker look. Another plus is the lack of extra padding. All these elements make the boots provide the control over the ball you need on the pitch. The foam pads from the Tiempo 9 have been reduced so your foot can be even closer to the ball. Instead, special lines have been embossed on the boots. The All Conditions Control (ACC) technology adds texture for increased grip, so you can move confidently in any weather conditions.Natural fitThe technologically advanced Flytouch Plus leather is unbelievably soft. It helps the boots fit your foot perfectly, providing comfort without overstretching the material. The Flyknit material around the ankle gives a secure fit feeling.Grip on the pitchThe plate connects the conical studs on the heel, providing optimal grip and stability when braking and changing direction in any conditions.",

This model will provide you and the fastest players with the acceleration you need to break through the defense line. As a result, we have created the most dynamic Mercurial shoes we have ever designed. All to satisfy your pursuit of perfection.Exceptional ball feelNike Gripknit is a grippy material that provides better ball feel. It has a larger surface area, giving you more space to control the ball during high-speed dribbling or to finish the game with an accurate shot on goal. In addition, it conforms to the shape of the foot and provides consistent grip in both wet and dry conditions, ensuring a snug fit comparable to track spikes. The embossed microtexture works with Gripknit technology, conforming to the foot and allowing for even better ball feel.Dynamic gripThe wavy tread pattern created by the cascadingly placed cleats covers a larger surface area in the Air Zoom cushion area and provides proper grip. The largest cleat has the same height as traditional mid cleats, so the grip is consistent everywhere. In addition to the wavy tread, we have also used studs in the shape of fir trees and blades, which make it easier to stop during dynamic turns.Perfect fitThe Flyknit upper is designed for speed. The Atomknit fabric, an extremely lightweight and durable version of Flyknit, is placed on the sides to reduce the weight of the shoes and provide support. By combining Gripknit, Atomknit, and Flyknit technologies, we have created the thinnest Mercurial upper, allowing for better ball feel and faster adaptation to the foot.",

That's why these Elite cleats with an improved 3/4 length Air Zoom unit were created. They provide you and the fastest players in this sport with the speed needed to break through the defensive line.Exceptional touchNike Gripknit is a sticky material that provides better contact with the ball. It covers a larger surface area, giving you more space to control the ball while dribbling at high speed or finishing the game with a shot on goal. It conforms to the shape of your foot and provides consistent grip in wet and dry conditions, ensuring a sculpted, spike-like fit. The micro-texture works with Gripknit to help mold to your foot, providing even better strikes with the cleats.Fast tractionThe wave-like traction pattern is a series of cascading ridges, engaging a larger surface area of the Air Zoom unit while still providing proper grip. The largest ridge is the same height as our traditional midfoot ridges, so grip is not compromised. We combined the wave-like ridge with fir tree and blade-shaped ridges to help you stop during quick cuts.FitThe entire Flyknit upper is designed for speed. Atomknit, an incredibly lightweight and durable Flyknit, narrows the weight on the sides and provides support. Gripknit, Atomknit, and Flyknit come together to create the thinnest Mercurial upper to date, bringing you closer to the ball and shortening the adaptation time.",

            "description": "Step into a new day and show the world what you're made of. A bright, iridescent plate, futuristic graphics and vibrant colors reminiscent of a gradient sunrise evoke the powerful female game. This is a power that can unite us on and off the pitch. We've taken feedback from athletes to provide the traction you need to play fast and confidently. That's what football is all about after all. The studs designed with craftsmanship in mind allow for precise turns when the game picks up speed and give a national flair.Traction on the pitchThe Nike Cyclone 360 pattern allows for quick and agile movements that give you confidence to dynamically change direction and feel secure when the game picks up speed.Better touchNike Gripknit is a grippy material that provides better ball touch. It covers the first two laces and the increased surface area improves ball control. Additionally, it conforms to the shape of your foot and provides consistent traction in both wet and dry conditions. The embossed micro-texture works with the Gripknit technology to conform to your foot and give you even better ball touch.Proper fit and stabilityThe asymmetrical lacing allows for a larger contact area when dribbling, passing and scoring. The modified lacing pattern increases the adjustability in the midfoot area, making it easier to fit those with a flatter or higher arch. The asymmetrical Flyknit collar provides a snug fit. The subtle drawcords in the collars allow for better ball contact with the ground around the ankle when receiving and passing.",

Now, for the first time in history, the Tiempo model is made of advanced leather technology providing better ball feel and perfect fit. It is lighter, sleeker and more modern than any other version and has been designed for every position on the pitch. It will allow you to pass the ball through the defensive line with watchmaker precision as well as repel the opponent's quick attack.Soft to the touchThe new advanced leather upper is incredibly soft, allowing the boots to mould to the foot, providing a natural ball feel without stretching the material after long hours of play.Sleekness and lightnessThe foam cushions of the Tiempo 9 have been reduced so that the foot can be even closer to the ball. Instead, special lines are embossed on the boots. Microscopic dots support the ball contact area for passes, shots and dribbling. This gives the boots a more sleek look. The lack of additional lining does not affect the ball control you need on the pitch.Stop and startThe plate combines different shapes of studs in the heel area: flat ones that increase stability and conical ones that provide better grip when braking.Speed and freedomThe Flyknit material around the ankle is comfortable and flexible.The All Conditions Control (ACC) finish ensures reliable ball feel in both dry and wet weather.The plastic plates with profiled studs are designed for artificial surfaces that mimic the look and feel of playing on grass.",

This model will provide you and the fastest players with the acceleration you need to break through the defense line. As a result, we have created the most dynamic Mercurial shoes we have ever designed. All of this to satisfy your pursuit of perfection.Exceptional ball feelNike Gripknit is a grippy material that provides better ball feel. It has a larger surface area, giving you more space to control the ball during high-speed dribbling or to finish the game with an accurate shot on goal. In addition, it conforms to the shape of the foot and provides consistent grip in both wet and dry conditions, ensuring a snug fit comparable to track spikes. The embossed microtexture works with Gripknit technology, conforming to the foot and allowing for an even better ball feel.Dynamic gripThe wavy tread pattern created by the cascadingly placed cleats covers a larger surface area in the Air Zoom cushion area and provides proper grip. The largest cleat has the same height as traditional mid cleats, so the grip is consistent everywhere. In addition to the wavy tread, we have also used studs in the shape of fir trees and blades, which make it easier to stop during dynamic turns.Perfect fitThe Flyknit upper is designed with speed in mind. The Atomknit fabric, an extremely lightweight and durable version of Flyknit, is placed on the sides to reduce the weight of the shoes and provide support. By combining Gripknit, Atomknit, and Flyknit technologies, we have created the thinnest Mercurial upper, allowing for better ball feel and a faster fit to the foot. The Dynamic Fit collar is made of soft, flexible material and wraps around the ankle, providing a snug fit.",

            "description": "Do you have an obsession with speed? The biggest basketball stars have it too. That's why we created the Elite cleats with an improved 3/4 length Air Zoom cushion. This model will provide you and the fastest players with the acceleration you need to break through the defense line. As a result, we have created the most dynamic Mercurial shoes we have ever designed. All of this to satisfy your pursuit of perfection.Exceptional ball feelNike Gripknit is a grippy material that provides better ball feel. It has a larger surface area, giving you more space to control the ball during high-speed dribbling or to finish the game with an accurate shot on goal. In addition, it conforms to the shape of your foot and provides consistent grip in both wet and dry conditions, ensuring a snug fit comparable to track spikes. The embossed microtexture works with Gripknit technology, conforming to the foot and allowing for an even better ball feel.Dynamic gripThe wavy tread pattern created by the cascadingly placed cleats covers a larger surface area in the Air Zoom cushion area and provides proper grip. The largest cleat has the same height as traditional mid cleats, so the grip is consistent everywhere. In addition to the wavy tread, we have also used studs in the shape of fir trees and blades, which make it easier to stop during dynamic turns.Perfect fitThe Flyknit upper is designed for speed. The Atomknit fabric, an extremely lightweight and durable version of Flyknit, is placed on the sides to reduce the weight of the shoes and provide support. By combining Gripknit, Atomknit, and Flyknit technologies, we have created the thinnest Mercurial upper, allowing for better ball feel and a faster fit to the foot.",

It's softer than natural leather, so it moulds to your foot and, combined with All Conditions Control elements (grippy texture even in wet days) it will help you set the pace of the game. The Legend 10 boots are lighter and sleeker than any other Tiempo model, so they're suitable for any position \u2013 whether you're passing the ball through the defence with watchmaker precision or fending off a quick attack from the opposing team.Better touchSee those microscopic dots on the upper? They help the ball-to-boot contact area for passing, shooting and dribbling. That's why the boots have a sleeker look. Another plus is the lack of extra padding. All these elements make the boots provide the control over the ball you need on the pitch. The foam pads from the Tiempo 9 have been reduced so your foot can be even closer to the ball. Instead, special lines have been embossed on the boots. The All Conditions Control (ACC) technology adds texture for increased grip, so you can move confidently in any weather conditions.Natural fitThe technologically advanced Flytouch Plus leather is unbelievably soft. It helps the boots fit your foot perfectly, providing comfort without overstretching the material. The Flyknit material around the ankle gives a secure fit feeling.Grip on the pitchThe plate connects the conical studs on the heel, providing optimal grip and stability when braking and changing direction in any conditions.",

This model will provide you and the fastest players with the acceleration you need to break through the defense line.

All of this to satisfy your pursuit of perfection.Exceptional ball feelNike Gripknit is a grippy material that provides better ball feel. It has a larger surface area, giving you more space to control the ball during high-speed dribbling or to finish the game with an accurate shot on goal. In addition, it conforms to the shape of your foot and provides consistent grip in both wet and dry conditions, ensuring a snug fit comparable to track spikes. The embossed microtexture works with Gripknit technology, conforming to the foot and allowing for an even better ball feel.Dynamic gripThe wavy tread pattern created by the cascadingly placed cleats covers a larger surface area in the Air Zoom cushion area and provides proper grip. The largest cleat has the same height as traditional mid cleats, so the grip is consistent everywhere. In addition to the wavy tread, we have also used studs in the shape of fir trees and blades, which make it easier to stop during dynamic turns.Perfect fitThe Flyknit upper is designed for speed. The Atomknit fabric, an extremely lightweight and durable version of Flyknit, is placed on the sides to reduce the weight of the shoes and provide support.

            "description": "Change the game with the bold design of the Superfly 9 Elite SG-Pro boots. We've incorporated Zoom Air cushioning, specifically designed for football, and a textured upper for an unparalleled touch, so you can give it your all in those last, decisive minutes of the match. Feel explosive speed on the pitch and play the ball with lightning speed. Fast is in the Air. The Anti-Clog Traction technology in the sole plate protects against mud build-up.Welcome to the pitch, ZoomFor the first time ever, Nike has developed an entirely new Zoom Air cushioning specifically designed for football, which stretches across 3/4 of the length of the boot. Placed in the plate, it gives an even better feeling of responsiveness and allows you to move faster on the pitch and find free space in the most important moments of the match to score or escape defenders.Boost your speedThe reinforcement responsible for speed, placed inside the entire structure, is made of a thin but strong material that keeps the foot on the outer sole and provides optimal fit without unnecessary loading.Anchor and goMetal studs on the outer sole provide unparalleled grip and allow you to quickly detach the boots from the ground.Even better fitThe soft and stretchy Flyknit wraps the ankle and provides a precise fit. The improved shape is characterized by a better fit around the foot. We achieved this result thanks to the involvement of hundreds of athletes testing our product. This allowed us to get a better profiled toe and a more fitted heel.Feel the ballThe upper is made of Vaporposite material, which combines a textured mesh with top-quality material, providing optimal control of the ball at high speeds. The material makes the entire upper surface pleasant to the touch. It wraps the foot precisely and softly, while stabilizing it, which translates into a more natural feel of the ball during dribbling, passing or shooting at the goal.",

            "description": "Even legends undergo constant changes. The latest version of these Elite boots is made from a completely new, technologically advanced Flytouch Plus leather. It is softer than natural leather, so it adapts to the foot and, together with the All Conditions Control elements (grippy texture even on rainy days), will help you set the pace of the game. The Legend 10 boots are lighter and slimmer than any other Tiempo model, making them suitable for playing any position - whether you pass the ball through the defensive line with watchmaker precision or fend off a quick attack from the opposing team. The Anti-Clog Traction solution applied to the sole plate protects against mud sticking.Better feelDo you see those microscopic dots on the upper? They support the ball contact area for passing, shooting and dribbling, giving the boots a slimmer look. Another advantage is the lack of additional lining. All these elements make the boots provide the control over the ball you need on the field. The foam pads from the Tiempo 9 have been reduced so that the foot can be even closer to the ball. Instead, special lines are embossed on the boots. The All Conditions Control (ACC) technology adds texture for increased grip, so you can move confidently in any weather conditions.Natural fitThe technologically advanced Flytouch Plus leather is unbelievably soft. It helps the boots fit perfectly to the foot, providing comfort without excessive stretching of the material. The Flyknit material around the ankle gives a feeling of secure fit.Grip on the fieldThe sole plate connects the conical studs on the heel, providing optimal grip and stability when braking and changing direction in any conditions.",

            "description": "Even legends undergo constant transformations. The latest version of these Elite cleats is made of a completely new, technologically advanced Flytouch Plus leather. It is softer than natural leather, which allows it to mold to the foot and, together with the All Conditions Control elements (a grippy texture even on rainy days), will help you set the pace of the game. The Legend 10 shoes are lighter and sleeker than any other Tiempo models, making them suitable for playing in any position - whether you're passing the ball with watchmaker precision through the defensive line or defending against a fast attack from the opposing team. The Anti-Clog Traction solution used in this version on the soleplate prevents mud from sticking.Do you see those microscopic dots on the upper? They enhance the ball-to-boot contact zone for passing, shooting, and dribbling. This gives the shoes a sleeker look. Another advantage is the lack of additional padding. All of these elements provide the ball control you need on the field. The foam cushions from the Tiempo 9 model have been reduced so that the foot can be even closer to the ball. Instead, special lines are embossed on the cleats. The All Conditions Control (ACC) technology adds texture for increased grip, allowing you to move confidently in any weather conditions.The technologically advanced FlyTouch Plus leather is incredibly soft. It helps the cleats perfectly mold to the foot, providing comfort without excessive stretching of the material. The Flyknit material around the ankle gives a feeling of secure fit.",

            "description": "Change the game with the bold design of the Superfly 9 Elite SG-Pro boots. We've incorporated Zoom Air cushioning, specifically designed for football, and a textured upper for an unparalleled touch, so you can give it your all in those last, decisive minutes of the match. Feel explosive speed on the pitch and play the ball with lightning speed. Fast is in the Air. The Anti-Clog Traction technology in the sole plate protects against mud build-up.Welcome to the pitch, ZoomFor the first time ever, Nike has developed an entirely new Zoom Air cushioning specifically designed for football, which stretches across 3/4 of the length of the boot. Placed in the plate, it gives an even better feeling of responsiveness and allows you to move faster on the pitch and find free space in the most important moments of the match to score or escape defenders.Boost your speedThe reinforcement responsible for speed, placed inside the entire structure, is made of a thin but strong material that keeps the foot on the outer sole and provides optimal fit without unnecessary loading.Anchor and goMetal studs on the outer sole provide unparalleled grip and allow you to quickly detach the boots from the ground.Even better fitThe soft and stretchy Flyknit wraps the ankle and provides a precise fit. The improved shape is characterized by a better fit around the foot. We achieved this result thanks to the involvement of hundreds of athletes testing our product. This allowed us to get a better profiled toe and a more fitted heel.Feel the ballThe upper is made of Vaporposite material, which combines a textured mesh with top-quality material, providing optimal control of the ball at high speeds. The material makes the entire upper surface pleasant to the touch. It wraps the foot precisely and softly, while stabilizing it, which translates into a more natural feel of the ball during dribbling, passing or shooting at the goal.",

            "description": "Take control of the pitch with the Vapor 15 Elite SG-Pro. Featuring Nike's revolutionary Zoom Air cushioning, specifically designed for football, and a textured upper for an unparalleled touch on the ball, you can give it your all even in the last few minutes of the match. Feel explosive speed on the pitch and play the ball with lightning speed. Fast is in the Air.For the first time ever, Nike has developed a completely new Zoom Air cushioning specifically designed for football, which extends over 3/4 of the length of the shoe. It is placed in the plate, giving an even better feeling of responsiveness and allowing you to move faster on the pitch and find free space in the most important moments of the match to score or escape defenders.The speed reinforcement inside the entire construction is made of a thin but strong material that keeps the foot on the outer sole and provides optimal fit without unnecessary load.Metal studs on the outer sole provide unparalleled grip and allow you to quickly detach the shoes from the ground.The improved fit is characterized by a better fit around the foot. This was achieved through the involvement of hundreds of athletes testing the product. This allowed for a better profiled toe and a more fitted heel.The upper is made of Vaporposite material, which combines a textured mesh with top quality material, providing optimal control of the ball at high speeds. The material makes the entire upper surface pleasant to the touch. It wraps the foot precisely and softly, while stabilizing it, which translates into a more natural feel of the ball during dribbling, passing or scoring goals.",

            "description": "Even legends undergo constant changes. The latest version of these Elite boots is made from a completely new, technologically advanced Flytouch Plus leather. It is softer than natural leather, so it adapts to the foot and, together with the All Conditions Control elements (grippy texture even on rainy days), will help you set the pace of the game. The Legend 10 boots are lighter and slimmer than any other Tiempo model, making them suitable for playing any position - whether you pass the ball through the defensive line with watchmaker precision or fend off the opponent's quick attack. The Anti-Clog Traction solution used in this version protects against mud sticking in the sole.Better feelingDo you see those microscopic dots on the upper? They support the ball contact area for passing, shooting and dribbling, giving the boots a slimmer look. Another advantage is the lack of additional lining. All these elements make the boots provide the control over the ball you need on the field. The foam pads from the Tiempo 9 have been reduced so that the foot can be even closer to the ball. Instead, special lines are embossed on the boots. The All Conditions Control (ACC) technology adds texture for increased grip, so you can move confidently in any weather conditions.Natural fitThe technologically advanced Flytouch Plus leather is unbelievably soft. It helps the boots fit perfectly to the foot, providing comfort without excessive stretching of the material. The Flyknit material around the ankle gives a feeling of secure fit.Grip on the fieldThe plate connects the conical studs on the heel, providing optimal grip and stability when braking and changing direction in any conditions.",
